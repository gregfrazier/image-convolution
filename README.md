Image Processing with Matrix Convolution (Kernels)

Very simple code, it's a product of a research project I'm working on. Note: it uses wrapping during the matrix operations, that can be easily changed to repeating or whatever you want by modding getBitmapPoint. It does support multi-direction filters, like Sobel.
